# Predicting_the_stock_market
In this project, we'll be working with data from the S&amp;P500 Index. We'll be using historical data on the price of the S&amp;P500 Index to make predictions about future prices. Predicting whether an index will go up or down will help us forecast how the stock market as a whole will perform.
